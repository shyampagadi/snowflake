What is Snowflake?
Snowflake is a cloud-native data warehouse that provides:
•	Elastic scalability: Automatic scaling of compute resources.
•	Separation of compute and storage: Allows independent scaling of storage and computational power.
•	Multi-cloud compatibility: Runs on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
•	Performance and concurrency: Optimized for high-speed querying and multiple concurrent users.
Why Snowflake is Unique
•	No Infrastructure Management: Fully managed; no need for hardware or software installation.
•	Data Sharing and Collaboration: Share data across organizations without complex ETL pipelines.
•	Semi-Structured Data Support: Handles JSON, Avro, and Parquet directly.
•	Time Travel: Query historical data without needing backups.
Hands-On Exercise:
1.	Visit the Snowflake website and create a free trial account.
2.	Familiarize yourself with the dashboard layout.
________________________________________
2. Understanding Snowflake Architecture
Snowflake’s Key Components
1.	Cloud Services Layer:
o	Manages metadata, authentication, and infrastructure.
o	Handles query parsing and optimization.
2.	Compute Layer (Virtual Warehouses):
o	Independent clusters of compute resources.
o	Can scale horizontally for high concurrency or vertically for large workloads.
3.	Storage Layer:
o	Shared and elastic storage for structured and semi-structured data.
o	Data is stored in micro-partitions (compressed, columnar storage).
How Snowflake Differentiates:
•	Separation of Storage and Compute: Unlike traditional databases, Snowflake decouples these two layers, enabling flexible scaling.
•	Concurrency without Locking: Uses metadata services for query optimization without table locking.
Hands-On Exercise:
•	Log in to your Snowflake account and explore:
o	Query History Tab: Tracks executed queries.
o	Resource Monitor: Monitors credit consumption.
________________________________________
3. Core Concepts
1. Databases, Schemas, and Tables
•	Database: Logical grouping of schemas and objects (e.g., tables, views).
•	Schema: Logical grouping of related tables and other objects within a database.
•	Tables: The actual data storage objects.
Hands-On Exercise:
1.	Create a database:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE my_database;
2.	Create a schema:
sql
Copy code
CREATE SCHEMA my_schema;
3.	Create a table:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE my_schema.my_table (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
2. Virtual Warehouses
•	Virtual warehouses are the compute resources in Snowflake.
•	Key Properties:
o	Independent from storage.
o	Elastic: Start, stop, and resize dynamically.
o	Caching: Optimizes query performance using result and metadata caching.
Hands-On Exercise:
1.	Create a virtual warehouse:
sql
Copy code
CREATE WAREHOUSE my_warehouse WITH 
WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL' 
AUTO_SUSPEND = 60 
AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;
2.	Start and stop the warehouse:
sql
Copy code
ALTER WAREHOUSE my_warehouse RESUME;
ALTER WAREHOUSE my_warehouse SUSPEND;
3. Stages
•	Internal Stages: Snowflake-provided storage for temporary data loading.
•	External Stages: Connected to cloud storage like S3, Azure Blob, or GCS.
Hands-On Exercise:
•	Create an internal stage:
sql
Copy code
CREATE STAGE my_stage;
4. Roles and Permissions
•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
o	Assign privileges to roles instead of individual users.
o	Example roles: ACCOUNTADMIN, SYSADMIN, PUBLIC.
Hands-On Exercise:
1.	Grant access to a role:
sql
Copy code
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE my_database TO ROLE my_role;
________________________________________
4. Snowflake’s Key Features

Week 3: Advanced SQL and Semi-Structured Data in Snowflake – Detailed Guide
This week delves into advanced SQL techniques and handling semi-structured data in Snowflake. Mastering these topics will enable you to perform complex transformations and work with modern data formats like JSON and Parquet.
________________________________________
1. Advanced SQL
1.1 Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
CTEs simplify complex queries by allowing you to create temporary named result sets.
Basic CTE:
•	Temporary query results used in subsequent queries.
sql
Copy code
WITH user_totals AS (
    SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
    FROM my_schema.orders
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT u.username, ut.total_spent
FROM my_schema.users u
JOIN user_totals ut
ON u.user_id = ut.user_id;
1.2 Window Functions
Window functions perform calculations across a defined "window" of rows.
1.	Ranking Functions:
sql
Copy code
SELECT username, amount,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY amount DESC) AS rank
FROM my_schema.orders;
2.	Aggregates Over Windows:
sql
Copy code
SELECT username, amount,
       SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id) AS total_spent
FROM my_schema.orders;
3.	Running Totals:
sql
Copy code
SELECT username, amount,
       SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total
FROM my_schema.orders;
1.3 Time Travel
Query historical data using AT or BEFORE clauses.
1.	Query a table at a specific point in time:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM my_schema.orders AT (TIMESTAMP => '2024-12-01 12:00:00');
2.	Undo a delete with Time Travel:
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO my_schema.orders
SELECT * FROM my_schema.orders BEFORE (TIMESTAMP => CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
________________________________________
2. Working with Semi-Structured Data
Snowflake provides native support for semi-structured data types, including JSON, Avro, ORC, and Parquet.
2.1 Data Types for Semi-Structured Data
1.	VARIANT:
o	Stores JSON, Avro, ORC, Parquet, or XML data.
2.	ARRAY:
o	Stores ordered collections of data.
3.	OBJECT:
o	Key-value pairs (similar to dictionaries in Python).
Example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE my_schema.json_data (
    id INT,
    raw_data VARIANT
);
2.2 Loading Semi-Structured Data
Load JSON or other formats into a VARIANT column.
1.	Stage the file:
sql
Copy code
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE my_stage;
2.	Load data:
sql
Copy code
COPY INTO my_schema.json_data
FROM @my_stage/json_file.json
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = JSON);
2.3 Querying JSON Data
Use the : operator to access keys and attributes.
1.	Access nested attributes:
sql
Copy code
SELECT raw_data:id::INT AS user_id,
       raw_data:profile.name::STRING AS username
FROM my_schema.json_data;
2.	Flatten JSON Arrays:
o	Use the FLATTEN function.
sql
Copy code
SELECT id, f.value AS order
FROM my_schema.json_data,
     LATERAL FLATTEN(input => raw_data:orders) f;
________________________________________
3. Flattening Nested Data
Flattening is essential when working with deeply nested JSON or ARRAY data.
Example JSON:
json
Copy code
{
  "id": 1,
  "profile": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com"
  },
  "orders": [
      {"order_id": 101, "amount": 250.50},
      {"order_id": 102, "amount": 125.75}
  ]
}
Flatten Nested Attributes:
1.	Extract Profile Details:
sql
Copy code
SELECT raw_data:profile.name::STRING AS username,
       raw_data:profile.email::STRING AS email
FROM my_schema.json_data;
2.	Extract Orders Using FLATTEN:
sql
Copy code
SELECT id, f.value:order_id::INT AS order_id, f.value:amount::FLOAT AS amount
FROM my_schema.json_data,
     LATERAL FLATTEN(input => raw_data:orders) f;
________________________________________

o	ELT (Extract, Load, Transform): Data is loaded into Snowflake first, then transformations occur within Snowflake.
Best Practice: Snowflake favors ELT because of its ability to scale compute resources on demand for transformations.
2.	Building ELT Pipelines:
o	Load raw data from external sources (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob, or Google Cloud Storage) into Snowflake.
o	Transform data using SQL.
sql
Copy code
COPY INTO raw_data_stage
FROM @s3_stage
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV');

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE transformed_data AS
SELECT column1, column2, 
       CASE 
          WHEN column3 = 'value' THEN 'new_value' 
          ELSE column3 
       END AS column3_transformed
FROM raw_data_stage;
3.	Use of Streams and Tasks for ELT Pipelines:
o	Streams track changes in the data.
o	Tasks automate the execution of ELT steps at scheduled intervals.
o	Example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE STREAM sales_stream ON TABLE raw_sales_data;

CREATE TASK transform_sales_data
WAREHOUSE = 'compute_wh'
SCHEDULE = '1 HOUR'
AS
INSERT INTO transformed_sales_data
SELECT * FROM sales_stream;
________________________________________
1.2 Data Integration with External Systems
1.	Snowflake Connectors:
o	Use Snowflake’s connectors for real-time data streaming and batch processing from external systems (e.g., Apache Kafka, Spark).
o	Example: Using Kafka Connector:
	Configure Kafka to stream data into Snowflake using the Snowflake Kafka Connector.
2.	Data Replication:
o	Replicate data across Snowflake accounts or regions using Snowflake’s built-in replication feature.
sql
Copy code
ALTER DATABASE sales_db ENABLE REPLICATION TO REGION 'us-west-2';
________________________________________
1.3 Handling Large-Scale Data Processing
1.	Data Partitioning and Clustering:
o	Partitioning helps in dividing large datasets for improved performance.
o	Clustering reduces scanning costs in large tables.
sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE large_sales_data CLUSTER BY (sale_date, region);
2.	Multi-Cluster Warehouses:
o	Set up multi-cluster warehouses for high concurrency workloads:
sql
Copy code
ALTER WAREHOUSE compute_wh SET MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 5;
3.	Cost Optimization:
o	Set up auto-suspend and auto-resume for warehouses to minimize costs.
